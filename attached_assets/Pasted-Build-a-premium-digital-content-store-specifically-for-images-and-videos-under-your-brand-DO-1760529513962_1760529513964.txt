Build a **premium digital content store** specifically for images and videos, under your brand **"DOCUEDIT PHOTOS"**. Let’s break down the complete feature list and architecture that would fit your needs. 

---

## ✅ **Platform Overview:**

A custom web platform (desktop + mobile responsive) where:

* **You (admin)** upload and manage images/videos (either from local storage or Google Drive links).
* **Users** browse, preview watermarked versions (no download/screenshot), add to cart, pay ₦200 per item, and then access the original HQ versions after purchase.
* The system supports **clearing carts** (for new setups or batch changes).
* There are **two main content sections**: **Images** and **Videos**.

---

## 🔧 Main Features & Requirements

### 1. **Admin Features (Your Control Panel)**

* Upload images/videos directly (drag & drop or file picker).
* Add from **Google Drive links** (auto-fetch metadata and thumbnails).
* Organize uploads into:

  * **Images**
  * **Videos**
* Preview and manage all uploaded content.
* Delete files or **clear all items from carts** for user sessions.
* Add or update watermark text: `DOCUEDIT PHOTOS`.

---

### 2. **User Experience (Frontend)**

#### Browsing:

* Two sections: 📸 **Images** | 🎥 **Videos**
* Thumbnail grid for easy browsing.
* Watermarked previews (can’t download or screenshot).
* Add items to **Cart** with “₦200 each” label.

#### Security:

* **Watermark**: Applied on all previews with **“DOCUEDIT PHOTOS”**.
* **Screenshot blocking** (to the extent browser tech allows).
* **Right-click disabled**, overlays over images, and JavaScript protection.

> Note: While screenshot-blocking isn't 100% foolproof, modern techniques (CSS overlays, JavaScript intercepts, and blurred previews) can **strongly discourage casual theft**.

#### Cart & Checkout:

* Cart tracks selected images/videos.
* Total price = ₦200 x items.
* “**Clear Cart**” option for users.
* Pay securely (recommend **Paystack** or **Flutterwave** for Nigerian payments).

#### After Payment:

* Users get access to **only the purchased files** in high resolution.
* Files are downloadable from a **secured, time-limited** link.
* Could optionally email receipt + links.

---

### 3. **Technology Stack Recommendation**

#### 🔗 Frontend (UI/UX):

* **React.js + Tailwind CSS** (or Next.js for better SEO/performance)
* Fully responsive (desktop/tablet/mobile)
* Modern UI with image grids, tab views, animations.

#### ⚙️ Backend:

* **Node.js + Express** or **Django (Python)** – secure, scalable.
* Handles file serving, authentication, watermark processing, etc.

#### 💾 File Storage:

* Upload directly or:
* **Google Drive Integration**: Allow reading/fetching images or videos from shared drive links. Use Google Drive API to pull thumbnails, previews, metadata.

#### 💸 Payment Integration:

* **Paystack** (ideal for Nigeria)
* Flat rate ₦200 per item
* Secure checkout with webhooks to confirm payment and unlock file access

#### 🔐 Security:

* Anti-screenshot: JS-based detection + overlays
* Watermark previews only
* Watermarking via Cloudinary or built-in image processing
* Unique download URLs for buyers (expire after X hours)
